## Profile

Current stability-best research profile:

## Change

The current best keeps the Dec-ISLP-Off profile and adds a smarter low-volatility ISLP guard:

- `InpInSessionLiquidityPullbackMinATR=0.00`
- `InpInSessionLiquidityPullbackLowATRRequireOrderFlow=true`
- `InpInSessionLiquidityPullbackLowATRThreshold=5.00`

Meaning:

Low-ATR ISLP trades are still allowed, but only when order flow confirms.

## Why It Replaced Dec-ISLP-Off

The blunt MinATR5 guard was rejected because it removed the October 2024 loser but also deleted a larger June 2024 winner.

The LowATR OrderFlow guard fixed that tradeoff:

- It kept the June 2024 low-ATR ISLP winner because order flow confirmed.
- It blocked the October 2024 low-ATR ISLP loser because order flow did not confirm.

## Provisional Caution

The Dec-ISLP-Off component remains an overfit risk because the original December improvement came from a very small number of December observations. Keep it as a risk-control candidate, not a proven permanent market rule.

The LowATR OrderFlow addition is stronger than the blunt MinATR filter because it preserved a known winner while removing a known loser, but it still needs full risk statistics and wider out-of-sample validation.

Decision:

Promoted as the current stability-best research profile, but only provisionally.

## Caveats

This is not a live-ready production profile.

Remaining gaps:

- Monthly and quarterly validation need reruns with tester-stat export enabled.
- Model1 and Model2 have not yet been rerun on this LowATR OrderFlow candidate.
- Older-data, walk-forward, Monte Carlo, and broker-variation testing are still missing.
- Local `Professional_XAUUSD_EA.mq5` is ahead of the GitHub source and contains the new optional guard.

Adaptive Reverse remains disabled.
